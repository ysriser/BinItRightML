# Bin-It-Right ML

This repo currently focuses on **image classification**.  
We keep different datasets in separate folders so configs and code stay clean.

## Common folders
- `ml/data/` (datasets, not committed)
- `ml/outputs/` (training outputs)
- `ml/artifacts/` (exported models)
- `ml/requirements.txt` (shared dependencies)
