# Bandit Configuration for AI/ML Training Scripts
# ------------------------------------------------
# This file defines the security policy for Python scripts within this repo.

# EXCLUSIONS
# These rules are skipped because they represent standard patterns in 
# machine learning that do not pose a security risk in this environment.
skips:
  # B311: Standard pseudo-random generators
  # EXPLANATION: We use 'random' for reproducible data shuffling and image 
  # augmentations. Cryptographic security is not required for these tasks, 
  # and secure alternatives (CSPRNGs) do not support seeding for reproducibility.
  - B311

  # B404: Import of subprocess module
  # EXPLANATION: High-level import is flagged as a risk for command injection. 
  # We use this module strictly for internal metadata collection (e.g., git hashes).
  - B404

  # B603: subprocess call - check for execution of untrusted input
  # EXPLANATION: We only execute hardcoded command lists (e.g., ["git", "rev-parse"]).
  # No untrusted user input is passed to the system shell.
  - B603

# TARGETS
# Target specific folders to prevent the scanner from wasting time on 
# environments or unrelated data directories.
targets:
  - 'CNN/experiments'
