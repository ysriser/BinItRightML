# Legacy Modules

This folder stores archived code paths that are no longer primary runtime targets.

## Purpose
- Preserve historical experiments and implementation attempts
- Keep traceability for assessment and presentation
- Avoid mixing old branches with active production code

## Structure
- `cnn/`: archived classification modules and older experiment versions
- `forecast/`: placeholder for archived forecast versions

## Note
Source code under `legacy/` can be committed.
Generated artifacts (outputs, checkpoints, caches) are ignored by root `.gitignore`.
